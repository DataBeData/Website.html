    <h1>Shelter From The Storm</h1>
    <h4>Bob Dylan</h4>
    <hr>
    <pre>
        t was in another lifetime, one of toil and blood
        When blackness was a virtue the road was full of mud
        I came in from the wilderness, a creature void of form
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        And if I pass this way again, you can rest assured
        I'll always do my best for her, on that I give my word
        In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        Not a word was spoke between us, there was little risk involved
        Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
        Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        I was burned out from exhaustion, buried in the hail
        Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail
        Hunted like a crocodile, ravaged in the corn
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        Suddenly I turned around and she was standin' there
        With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
        She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        Now there's a wall between us, somethin' there's been lost
        I took too much for granted, I got my signals crossed
        Just to think that it all began on a noneventful morn
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        Well, the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
        But nothing really matters much, it's doom alone that counts
        And the one-eyed undertaker, he blows a futile horn
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        I've heard newborn babies wailin' like a mournin' dove
        And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
        Do I understand your question, then, is it hopeless and forlorn?
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        In a little hilltop village, they gambled for my clothes
        I bargained for salvation and she gave me a lethal dose
        I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

        Well, I'm livin' in a foreign country, but I'm bound to cross the line
        Beauty walks a razor's edge, someday I'll make it mine
        If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
        "Come in," she said
        "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
